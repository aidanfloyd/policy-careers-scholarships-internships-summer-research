## About Summer Research Programs

### What is a Summer Research Program?

Summer Research Programs are a time-bound opportunity, typically 10-12 weeks in the summer that allow students the opportunity to work with faculty and experienced researchers to learn about research, engage in priceless mentorship, and explore a focus in a particular area of interest. Typically students in policy and poltical science engage in research projects that involve stakeholder engagement, literature review searches, data collection and analysis, and writing and presentation skills. 

### How does compensation work?

For paid opportunities students receive a stipend typically around $3000-$5000 depending on the program and benefits packages that may or may not include room and board, travel, and transportation expenses. 

### How do I find programs

As you begin your search for summer research programs in policy and political science, you may find yourself frustrated with the large amount of programs in the STEM field. Comprehensive databases are rare for finding summer research programs in the social sciences field. The best way to find opportunities is to visit research colleges websites, search by policy area interests with key word searches, and reach out to faculty and staff at your own school to find out if there are available funds for research assistantships. 

### How do I apply?

To prepare to apply to summer research programs, it is good practice to have at least two letters of recommendation (ideally from professors or related professional supervisors) and unofficial transcripts. In addition, you should be prepared to write short essays and answer short response questionnaires on your background and why you are interested in a specific opportunity (the more specific you can be the better!). Pay attention to timelines that programs post which outline when you should expect to hear back about interviews and official acceptance into the program. For interviews, you should be prepared to demonstrate a genuine excitement for research (even if you haven't done any before in a formal setting) and be able to explain how your related experiences in coursework and extracurricular activities have prepared you to take full advantage of opportunities. It is a best practice to have 2-3 questions prepared for the interviewer to pose at the close of the interview.
