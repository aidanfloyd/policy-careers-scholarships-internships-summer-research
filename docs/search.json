Economic policies are typically\r\nimplemented and administered by the government. Examples of economic\r\npolicies include decisions made about government spending and taxation,\r\nabout the redistribution of income from rich to poor, and about the\r\nsupply of money.\r\nGoals of economic policy:\r\nEconomic growth: Economic growth means that the incomes of all\r\nconsumers and firms (after accounting for inflation) are increasing over\r\ntime.\r\nFull employment: The goal of full employment is that every member\r\nof the labor force who wants to work is able to find work.\r\nPrice stability: The goal of price stability is to prevent\r\nincreases in the general price level known as inflation, as well as\r\ndecreases in the general price level known as deflation.\r\nExamples: https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1011/recession/solving-current-economic-problems/\r\nEnvironmental\r\nDefinition: any measure by a government or\r\ncorporation or other public or private organization regarding the\r\neffects of human activities on the environment, particularly those\r\nmeasures that are designed to prevent or reduce harmful effects of human\r\nactivities on ecosystems. (source)\r\nIssue Examples: https://earth.org/the-biggest-environmental-problems-of-our-lifetime/\r\nImmigration\r\nDefinition: An immigration policy is any policy of a\r\nstate that deals with the transit of persons across its borders into the\r\ncountry, but especially those that intend to work and stay in the\r\ncountry. Immigration policies can range from allowing no migration at\r\nall to allowing most types of migration, such as free immigration.\r\nOften, racial or religious bias is tied to immigration policy. Ethnic\r\nrelations policy within a country can usually be broadly categorized as\r\neither ‘assimilationist’ or ‘multiculturalist’. Nowadays, immigration\r\npolicy is often closely related to other policies and issues: Tax,\r\ntariff and trade rules that determine what goods immigrants may bring\r\nwith them, what services they may perform while temporarily in the\r\ncountry, and who is allowed to remain. (source)\r\nPurposes: There are five primary purposes of\r\nimmigration policy (US English Foundation, 2016; Fix & Passel,\r\n1994).\r\nSocial: Unify citizens and legal residents with their\r\nfamilies.\r\nEconomic: Increase productivity and standard of living.\r\nCultural: Encourage diversity, increasing pluralism and a variety\r\nof skills.\r\nMoral: Promote and protect human rights, largely through\r\nprotecting those feeling persecution.\r\nSecurity: Control undocumented immigration and protect national\r\nsecurity.\r\nHealthcare\r\nDefinition: Health policy is best understood as a\r\nset of overarching principles and goals that dictate how care is\r\ndelivered and accessed. Health care policy can be codified at a national\r\nor state level, and then more finely honed in a hospital or clinical\r\nenvironment. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as the\r\n“decisions, plans, and actions that are undertaken to achieve specific\r\nhealth care goals within a society.” This broad category can be broken\r\ndown into discrete policies, such as those related to mental health care\r\nand health care affordability. (source)\r\nTypes of Health Policy:\r\nGlobal health. Global health takes a big-picture view, assessing\r\nthe health needs of populations across the planet and striving to\r\nachieve equity of care.\r\nPublic health. Public health describes the policies enacted on a\r\nnational, state or community level to promote healthy lifestyles and\r\nprevent the spread of infectious diseases.\r\nPharmaceuticals. Health policy may touch on the regulation,\r\navailability and affordability of pharmaceutical products.\r\nFinancing. Health policy can determine how care is financed,\r\nincluding the extent to which the state reimburses health facilities for\r\ntheir services.\r\nMental health. Mental health care is a key consideration in\r\ncreating health policy, providing goals and objectives for promoting\r\nmental well-being and treating those with mental health\r\nconditions.\r\nHealth equity. A stated goal of many health policies is to ensure\r\nthat care is administered in a fair way, across different communities\r\nand demographics.\r\nInsurance. Heath policy may also determine the role that\r\ninsurance plays in financing care, promote affordable or public\r\ninsurance options, and regulate what insurers can and can’t do.\r\nHealth care services. The codification of a health policy will\r\ndirectly impact the kinds of health care services available in an\r\narea.\r\nEducation\r\nDefinition: Education policy refers to the\r\nlegislation, regulations, and resources that shape and impact the\r\ncurricula, environments, and teachers that students encounter. As such,\r\neducation policy focuses on the interconnectedness of budgets;\r\ncurriculum requirements; testing guidelines; infrastructures; teachers’\r\nunions; and private, faith-based, and public education systems.\r\nGovernment institutions at the local, state, and federal levels also\r\nhave a hand in implementing education policy. (source)\r\nEquity\r\nDefinition: Equity policies address the severe\r\ninequities between demographic groups. Equity policy seeks to address\r\nunequal access to opportunities that are critical to building equality\r\nfor underserved and underrepresented groups in systemic structures. (source)\r\nChallenges to Equity:\r\nIntersectional identities: Currently, certain sub-groups of the\r\nU.S. population do not have widespread access to key resources and\r\nopportunities. Many also face discrimination which actively harms their\r\nwellbeing. Equity-focused policies strive to ensure that all people in\r\nthe United States—regardless of race, immigration status, criminal\r\nrecord, and other factors—have a fair shot at achieving.\r\nSystemic forces: Even as outward displays of discrimination have\r\nlessened over the past century, the systems and institutions designed\r\nover that period remain at the center of our social and political life.\r\nThe many systems that reinforce inequality by reducing and limiting\r\nopportunities for economically insecure individuals must be\r\nreshaped.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolicy Organizations By\r\nSubject\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic\r\nEconomic Policy Organizations\r\nAmerican Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research\r\nAEI-Brookings Joint Center\r\nThe Atlas Economic Research Foundation\r\nThe Brookings Institution\r\nCato Institute\r\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)\r\nEconomic Policy Institute (EPI)\r\nThe Heartland Institute\r\nThe Heritage Foundation\r\nThe Hoover Institution\r\nInstitute for International Economics\r\nInstitute for Policy Studies\r\nJoint Center for Political and Economic Studies\r\nManhattan Institute for Policy Research\r\nNational Center for Policy Analysis\r\nReason Foundation\r\nAdditional Lists:\r\nhttps://www.eda.gov/resources/organizations/\r\nhttps://www.epi.org/archive/sr_national-orgsold/\r\nhttps://inomics.com/advice/top-economics-think-tanks-and-research-institutes-in-the-us-1025248\r\nEnvironmental\r\nEnvironmental Policy Organizations\r\nLists\r\nhttps://greendreamer.com/journal/environmental-organizations-nonprofits-for-a-sustainable-future\r\nhttps://www.momtastic.com/webecoist/2008/09/24/25-environmental-agencies-and-organizations/\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_environmental_research_institutes\r\nImmigration\r\nImmigration Policy Organizations\r\nAsian American Justice Center – Immigrant Rights\r\nACLU – Immigrants’ Rights\r\nAmerican-Arab Anti Discrimination Committee\r\nAmerican Friends Service Committee – Immigrants’ Rights\r\nAnti-Defamation League – Immigration Reports and Resources\r\nCatholic Legal Immigration Network\r\ncivilrights.org – Immigration\r\nFarmworker Justice – Immigration and Labor\r\nHebrew Immigrant Aid Society\r\nImmigrant Legal Resource Center\r\nImmigration Advocates Network\r\nImmigration Equality\r\nImmigrant Solidarity Network\r\nIrish Lobby for Immigration Reform\r\nJustice for Immigrants\r\nLutheran Immigration and Refugee Service\r\nMexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund\r\nNational Council of La Raza\r\nNational Immigrant Justice Center\r\nNational Immigration Forum\r\nNational Immigration Law Center\r\nNational Immigration Project\r\nNational Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights\r\nUnite Families\r\nVera’s Center on Immigration and Justice\r\nYoung Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights\r\nAdditional Lists:\r\nhttps://www.shusterman.com/immigration-organizations/\r\nhttps://stories.avvo.com/rights/immigration/10-nonprofit-organizations-help-immigration.html\r\nhttps://guides.library.columbia.edu/c.php?g=709736&p=5072094\r\nHealthcare\r\nNational Health Policy and Research\r\nOrganizations\r\nAcademyHealth\r\nAmerican Enterprise Institute\r\nBrookings Institute\r\nCATO Institute\r\nAlliance for Health Reform\r\nCenter for Studying Health System Change\r\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities\r\nCommonwealth Fund\r\nEconomic and Research Institute\r\nHeritage Foundation\r\nKaiser Family Foundation\r\nMathematica Health Policy Research\r\nNational Academy for State Health Policy\r\nNational Academy of Sciences: Health and Medicine Division\r\nRAND Health\r\nResearch Triangle Institute\r\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation\r\nState Health Access Data Assistance Center\r\nUrban Institute\r\nFederal Agencies\r\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality\r\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\r\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\r\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services\r\nAdditional Lists\r\nhttps://ushealthpolicygateway.com/whats-what-in-health-policy/policy-research-organizations/u-s-pros/\r\nhttps://nacns.org/advocacy-policy/advocacy-resources/health-policy-think-tanks/\r\nhttps://guides.emich.edu/c.php?g=187869&p=8082827\r\nEducation\r\nLists:\r\nhttps://www.theedadvocate.org/education-organizations-and-associations-a-definitive-list/\r\nhttps://www.educationnext.org/top-k-12-education-policy-organizations-and-media-outlets-on-social-media-2015/\r\nhttps://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=310710&p=2072678\r\nEquity\r\nNational Association for Equity, Diversity & Inclusion\r\nNational Alliance for Partnerships in Equity (NAPE)\r\nRacial Justice: https://racialequity.org/racial-justice-organizations-and-resources/\r\nMore: https://www.racialhealthequity.org/partners\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Typically students in policy and poltical science engage in\r\nresearch projects that involve stakeholder engagement, literature review\r\nsearches, data collection and analysis, and writing and presentation\r\nskills.\r\nHow does compensation work?\r\nFor paid opportunities students receive a stipend typically around\r\n$3000-$5000 depending on the program and benefits packages that may or\r\nmay not include room and board, travel, and transportation expenses.\r\nHow do I find programs\r\nAs you begin your search for summer research programs in policy and\r\npolitical science, you may find yourself frustrated with the large\r\namount of programs in the STEM field. Comprehensive databases are rare\r\nfor finding summer research programs in the social sciences field. The\r\nbest way to find opportunities is to visit research colleges websites,\r\nsearch by policy area interests with key word searches, and reach out to\r\nfaculty and staff at your own school to find out if there are available\r\nfunds for research assistantships.\r\nHow do I apply?\r\nTo prepare to apply to summer research programs, it is good practice\r\nto have at least two letters of recommendation (ideally from professors\r\nor related professional supervisors) and unofficial transcripts. In\r\naddition, you should be prepared to write short essays and answer short\r\nresponse questionnaires on your background and why you are interested in\r\na specific opportunity (the more specific you can be the better!). Pay\r\nattention to timelines that programs post which outline when you should\r\nexpect to hear back about interviews and official acceptance into the\r\nprogram. For interviews, you should be prepared to demonstrate a genuine\r\nexcitement for research (even if you haven’t done any before in a formal\r\nsetting) and be able to explain how your related experiences in\r\ncoursework and extracurricular activities have prepared you to take full\r\nadvantage of opportunities. It is a best practice to have 2-3 questions\r\nprepared for the interviewer to pose at the close of the interview.\r\n\r\nPREVIOUSLY OFFERED PROGRAMS\r\nSummer Research\r\nOpportunities Program (SROP)\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout\r\nProgram Website: https://www.btaa.org/resources-for/students/srop/overview\r\nDetails: The SROP is a gateway to graduate education\r\nat Big Ten Academic Alliance universities.
